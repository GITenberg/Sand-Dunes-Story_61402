<h3 id="c1">WELCOME!</h3>
<p>What do YOU see as YOU look across the dunes? Piles of lifeless
sand? A giant sandbox? Each of us sees the dunes differently. We would
like to share the story of the Death Valley Sand Dunes with you. This
booklet provides answers to some of your questions about the origin,
composition and formation of the dunes. We will also look at the plants,
and for evidence of animals that make their home here.</p>
<p>The features discussed are near the edge of the dunes and all you
need is your curiosity to explore this fascinating place. A magnifying glass
or magnet may add to your enjoyment. Remember&mdash;the dunes can be hot
in spring and fall as well as in summer months. Be sure to carry water,
distance is deceiving, and a short stroll may become an extended walk. Do
you want to walk barefoot? Be careful around the bushes; thorns and plant
debris are hidden in the sand. Carry your shoes, your feet may get tired, or
the sand may become too hot. When you are in the shade, look around to
see if other creatures are sharing the same cool place. This is home for such
desert dwellers as lizards, kangaroo rats and sidewinders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>There is no guided trail since wind can soon cover a trail with sand. It&rsquo;s
easy to find your way around and can be fun to choose your own route.
Look behind you to get firmly in your mind which mountain feature will be
your landmark to guide you back to your vehicle.</p>
<p>To make the best use of this booklet, flip through it to locate topics of
interest. Read in sequence, or follow the order of your discoveries. Use
your senses to appreciate and explore the sand dunes more fully. Pick up
some sand occasionally and compare the texture, temperature and other
qualities to that found in other locations. Be alert for little things&mdash;notice
plants, sand ripples, animal burrows and tracks.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk into the dunes a short distance and learn their secrets. To
form sand dunes, three things are needed: wind, sand, and a place for the
sand to collect. The story of the dunes involves interaction among these
factors and the plants and animals that make their homes in this sea of
sand.</p>
<h3 id="c2">WHY ARE THE DUNES HERE?</h3>
<p>Are they limited to this section of the valley? Do they migrate?
Answers to these questions are in the winds.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Winter and summer bring winds from different directions; northerly in
winter and southerly in summer. Landforms influence crosswinds and
swirling wind currents (eddies). These crosswind and eddy patterns result
in decreased wind speed and cause the sand to drop out in the same
general area time after time. Seasonal variations in wind direction help
keep the sand in one area.</p>
<p>Between individual dunes, white salt deposits are often seen on the
surface of an old clay lakebed (playa). Here too, we see how tall the dunes
are because the sand is piled entirely on top of this playa. Infrequent rains
produce changes in the playa surface, and occasionally gravel is washed
into the area from nearby mountains. Because of the clay content of the
soil, rain water does not soak in quickly, but lies in pools. As the pools
evaporate, fresh deposits of salts and minerals remain on the surface.
Similar salt deposits throughout the valley to the south minimize the
amount of available blowing sand by cementing it together.</p>
<p>Dunes in Death Valley consist of sand from local materials found in
nearby mountains. The primary source of this sand is believed to be the
Cottonwood Mountains to the west and northwest. Although the shapes
and patterns of individual dunes may vary daily or seasonally, the dune
field itself is relatively stable.</p>

<p>Pick up some sand! Is it fine or coarse? Wet or dry? Warm or cold?
Notice the different colors. A magnet may help you separate particles, and
a magnifying glass will allow you to examine them more closely. Most black
particles are magnetite&mdash;most white ones are
quartz. Other minerals provide still different
colors. The sand here is a product of
weathering by wind, rain and chemical
changes&mdash;breaking blocks of rock (primarily
granite) from nearby mountains into particles
small and light enough to be carried by run-off
and tossed around in the frequent desert
winds.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Take a close look at sand grains.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c3">HOW ARE DUNES AND RIPPLES FORMED?</h3>
<p>Each wind produces changes to the surface of the sand. It takes a 10
mph (16 kph) wind to move fine, dry sand. During a sandstorm, it may
seem as if the sand is blowing thousands of feet into the air. Your view of
the distant mountains may be obscured. Don&rsquo;t be fooled! The dunes are
not entirely airborne! What you see are dust particles being carried aloft
because they are smaller and lighter than sand grains. Seldom does
dune-sized sand itself rise more than 6 ft. (2 m) above the ground, it is too
heavy.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02b.jpg" alt="{Ripples}" width="800" height="531" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="{Movement of sand grains}" width="500" height="420" />
</div>
<p>Actually, most sand travels within about
18 in. (46 cm) of the ground in a jumping
movement called saltation. A windborne
grain bounces a short distance before
crashing into the sandy surface sending
other grains into flight. The process continues
as the wind carries the new grains a little
farther, crashing them, in turn, into the surface
and other grains along the way. Sand grains
too heavy to blow in the wind creep along
the surface of the sand, while smaller ones
are truly airborne above the dunes. As a
consequence, the entire sand surface flows
or creeps along.</p>
<p>Have you been comparing the texture, size and color of sand in
various sections of the dunes? Some differences will be more obvious if
you have the chance to visit both the tall dunes by Highway 190 and the
low ones by the picnic area. The soft, fine sand by the picnic area is carried
farther by the wind than the coarser material found in the taller dunes.</p>
<p>Smaller grains move farther than large ones. As a result of this sorting
of sand grains by variable winds, the larger grains accumulate in small
ridges forming ripples. Size and shape of these formations are related to
specific interactions between sand and wind. The windward side of a dune
generally has more dramatic sculpturing. Examine an area with interesting
ripples. Wind speed, direction, duration, and the amount of sand are
important factors that have been measured and used to determine the size
and spacing of dune ripples. Just as these ripples form, the dunes
themselves respond to changes in each of these factors.</p>

<p>All dunes may be described by the above traits. Variations in shape
and size of individual dunes are determined by the mathematical values
applied to each of the traits mentioned in the discussion of ripple
formation. Another feature of interest is the dune shape. Among these
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
dunes you may find examples of this classic textbook model and its
variations.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Plants on the playa in between the dunes</i></p>
</div>
<p>Note that the downwind side of the dune, the slipface, is the steeper
one. Fine dry sand can only pile up so high before it breaks away and
slides down the slipface as an avalanche to rest at the more stable angle
of repose, about 34 degrees. We create miniature avalanches as we walk
along the crest of a steep dune.</p>
<h3 id="c4">WHAT PLANTS LIVE HERE?</h3>
<p>Each area within the dunes has something different to offer. Low
dunes near the picnic area have more vegetation than the tall dunes near
Highway 190.</p>
<p>Plants, visible from the top of many dunes, help the dunes remain
here by stabilizing the sand with their branches and roots. You will see
different plants, depending on whether you are in the tall or low dunes.
You may find them in a different sequence from that used in this booklet.
By looking for different shades of green, you should find each of the major
shrubs and trees that live in the dunes. Use the diagrams and photos to
help identify those you see. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look to learn how they
survive and how they relate to the story of the dunes.</p>
<p>Can you find a low bush which appears to have no leaves? The stems
are jointed and succulent (juicy) and vary in color from yellowish to bright
green, depending on the season. Pickleweed (<i>Allenrolfea occidentalis</i>), is
often found on top of low mounds of sand. Do the stems look like tiny
pickles joined end-to-end? During summer months, tiny, inconspicuous,
yellow flowers may be seen at the joints. With a magnifying glass, you may
see the miniature leaves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="444" />
<p class="pcap">PICKLEWEED
<br />(<i>Allenrolfea occidentalis</i>)</p>
</div>
<p>By reducing leaf size, the plant minimizes
surface through which water can be lost.
Green stems assume the task of photosynthesis,
normally done by leaves, providing
food for the plant of this arid environment.</p>
<p>Although the sand does not often
appear wet, pickleweed suggests water is
not far below the surface. It requires a wet
soil and can grow in very salty areas. Watch
for pickleweed near Badwater also.</p>
<p>Find a different shrub, gently rub a leaf and smell it. Does it smell
faintly like fish? Look at the leaf you have just rubbed. Did the surface dust
rub off to reveal a deeper shade of green? Does it have fleshy leaves? If so,
you have found the inkweed (<i>Suaeda torryana</i>). If your shrub has a less
noticeable smell, and perhaps rubber-like texture, and if you did not easily
remove the white chalky coating from the
light gray green leaves, it is saltbush. If your
shrub has numerous tiny spines, be careful,
you may have found a Russian thistle (<i>Salsola
kali</i>) or tumbleweed, as it is also called. They
are not native to Death Valley, but have
become established in certain areas.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p04b.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="482" />
<p class="pcap">INKWEED
<br />(<i>Suaeda torryana</i>)</p>
</div>
<p>Inkweed&rsquo;s young succulent leaves and
seeds were used for food by local Shoshoni
Indians. Stems and leaves were processed to
make a black dye. You may notice tiny balls
of seeds at the very ends of some branches.
The green flowers are very inconspicuous.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p04c.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="530" />
<p class="pcap">FOUR-WING SALTBUSH
<br />(<i>Atriplex canescens</i>)</p>
</div>
<p>Saltbush is light green and its dry, flat leaves are covered with salt.
Roots remove salts from the soil and water, then the salt is deposited on
the outer surface of the leaves. Consequently, the whitened leaf surfaces
reflect sunlight, thereby reducing temperature
and water loss. There are male and female
saltbushes. You may want to search for seeds
or flowers. Seeds on female bushes have four
tiny wings which give it the name&mdash;four-wing
saltbush (<i>Atriplex canescens</i>). Seeds were
used as food by Shoshoni Indians.</p>
<p>On your way into the dunes did you
notice any other plants? If not, watch for them
as you return to your vehicle. Remember,
the kinds of plants vary depending on your
location in the dunes. The clumps of grass
near the picnic tables are alkali sacaton
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
(<i>Sporobolis airoides</i>). Approaching the tall
dunes you may have seen large plants with
small, shiny, smooth, dark green leaves&mdash;the
creosote bush (<i>Larrea tridentata</i>). It has small
yellow flowers, usually observed in
springtime. Later, small, fuzzy, white balls
containing seeds grow on its branches. The
larger green or brown, walnut shaped
growths on the branches are galls formed
in response to an insect invader (midge).
If you missed creosote bushes in the dunes,
watch for them along the roadsides&mdash;they
are common.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p04d.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="488" />
<p class="pcap">CREOSOTE BUSH
<br />(<i>Larrea tridentata</i>)</p>
</div>
<p>Although the sand dunes seem dry, there is an underground reservoir
providing moisture and nutrients for vegetation. The crusty mud playa acts
as a cap and reduces evaporation of the underground water supply.
Nearby, at Salt Creek, the same water flows on the surface as a stream
during the winter and spring.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p04e.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="476" />
<p class="pcap">MESQUITE
<br />(<i>Prosopis glandulosa</i>)</p>
</div>
<p>Most plants grow in the hollows between the dunes where they
receive some protection from the wind and can reach water more easily.
Yet, the mesquite tree (<i>Prosopis glandulosa</i>), probably the largest plant in
sight, is often on top of the dunes. By slowing the wind with its branches,
the mesquite causes sand to pile up in
mounds beneath it. Sometimes sand
completely covers a part of the tree causing
branches to die. The sand then blows away,
exposing those dead branches. Look for
an example which illustrates this sand
movement. Mesquite trees have thorns,
so be careful. The mesquite tree loses its
small, delicate leaves during winter. Its
deep root system, growing 50-60 ft. (16-20 m)
into the ground to reach fresh water, helps
the tree survive. Some plants, such as
saltbush, pickleweed, and mesquite seem
incompatible because of different mineral
and water requirements. However, these plants are able to live near each
other because their roots are drawing moisture and nutrients from different
levels of the soil. For example, in a rain forest, where the roots have ample
water, most plant growth is above ground where competition is for
sunlight. Whereas in a desert, where sunlight is abundant, competition
for water is more critical. The root system of desert plants are highly
developed, and each plant will find the optimum level in the soil suitable
for its growth.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Mesquite tree: sand collector, food and shelter for animals and Shoshoni.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Be careful not to trample the roots as you explore the mound of sand
near the mesquite tree&mdash;you may collapse a burrow&mdash;remember, you and
the animals may be sharing the same shade.</p>
<p>Mesquite trees are also special in that they produce an edible and
nutritious fruit. In late spring, tiny, yellow flower spikes hang from the
branches. These develop into yellow bean pods by late summer. Many
different animals use the beans for food. Mesquite beans were also a major
food source for the Shoshoni.</p>
<h3 id="c5">WHAT DID THE SHOSHONI DO HERE?</h3>
<p>Shoshoni Indians have lived in Death Valley for many
years&mdash;migrating to the mountains for the hot summer months and
returning to the valley for the winter. Their movements were related to
supplies of food and water and influence of temperature. It is more likely
that areas such as these sand dunes were visited for food gathering rather
than as a place of residence. To survive in the desert, the Shoshoni had
to learn which plants to eat, where they grew and when to harvest them.
They also learned which animals were reliable food sources&mdash;where they
could be found in abundance and when they were active.</p>
<p>Use your imagination&mdash;how well could you survive in this wild area?
Where and how would you find water? Which plants and animals would
you eat?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 id="c6">WHICH ANIMALS LIVE HERE?</h3>

<p class="pcap"><span class="ssn">BURROW</span></p>
</div>
<p>Guess which animal lives in which hole! How large is the entrance?
The size of the entrance suggests the size of the animal. How many other
openings are nearby? Often escape exits save rodents from predators. Are
there recent tracks nearby to indicate it is an active burrow, or is it covered
with sand and debris blown in by the wind?</p>
<p>Inside these burrows the temperature and living conditions are not as
extreme as those on the surface of the sand. Try digging a small hole in the
sand well away from bushes. How soon does the sand change as you dig?
Is it warmer or cooler or wetter? Beneath the surface the moderate
temperatures and increased moisture provide an escape from the intense
heat. Consequently, dune residents spend the day in their dens and are
active at night.</p>
<p>Kangaroo rats, for example, cannot tolerate heat and escape it by
living underground. Also they are active only at night. They are very
efficient water conservationists. Although water is essential to the kangaroo
rat, they rarely drink, but produce their own water from insects and dry
seeds they eat. They have no sweat glands, and excrete highly
concentrated wastes to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>These rodents are not related to kangaroos at all! Their name refers to
their hind legs which are highly developed for jumping.</p>
<p>Watch for their tracks&mdash;when a kangaroo rat is moving slowly, it drags
its tail which leaves a trail in the sand in conjunction with its foot prints.
When the rat moves quickly, its tail doesn&rsquo;t drag. From clues such as these
we can determine whether the rat is running from a predator or just
leisurely looking for food. The entrances to their burrows are about 4-5 in.
(10-12 cm) in diameter and may be 3 ft. (1 m) or more deep. Smaller
rodents, such as pocket mice, have similar habits but live in smaller
burrows.</p>
<p>Lizards are more active during daylight hours. Even though they
tolerate higher temperatures than rodents, they would perish if they were
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
stranded in the open sun for an extended period of time. Notice how they
run from bush to bush, seeking the protective coolness as well as cover.
Lizards are cold-blooded animals, responding to temperatures around
them&mdash;cold, inactive&mdash;warm, active. In the winter months, there is very little
lizard activity. However, summer days with ground temperatures reaching
200 degrees F. (92 degrees C.) or more are too hot for lizards, and they
must seek shelter. They eat plant material, insects and smaller lizards,
obtaining moisture from their food. They also conserve water by excreting
highly concentrated waste.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="pcap"><span class="ssn">LIZARDS</span></p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps least observed, but most inquired about dunes dweller, is the
sidewinder. Have you seen evidence of this rattlesnake today? It moves in
a sidewise manner leaving a series of parallel, J-shaped tracks in the sand.</p>
<p>By looping across the sand, the sidewinder reduces slippage over the
loose material and decreases the amount of body surface in contact with
the hot sand. Sidewinders are primarily active at night, and escape the heat
of the day under a bush or buried in the sand, exposing only the small
horn-like structures on their heads. They eat kangaroo rats, mice and
lizards.</p>
<p>Imagine the dunes as an ocean where all the sand is water and plants
are islands scattered about. Each island offers shelter and a food supply for
the animals. Everytime an animal leaves the security of an island it takes a
risk. In daylight, people may play in the sand, but at night the dunes come
alive with the real business of survival. Usually all we see of this activity the
following morning is the evidence&mdash;tracks. Some tracks are easily
identified&mdash;each tells a story. Use the diagrams to determine which animals
most recently crossed the sea of sand around you.</p>

<p>Coyotes come into the dunes
for food. True opportunists, they

mesquite beans and many other
things. Their tracks are difficult to
distinguish from those left by
domestic dogs. Smaller dog-like
tracks are left by the kit fox. These
small foxes have large ears and
well padded feet. They too feed
on small rodents. Coyotes and kit
foxes receive moisture from their
food and drink water at springs
within their hunting range. They
avoid exposure to heat by being
active at night and staying in dens
or shaded areas during the heat of
the day.</p>

<p>Jackrabbits are not seen

their tracks and droppings are

on plants, getting moisture
from their food rather than from distant springs. Large ears radiate excess
body heat and help cool the animal as it rests in shaded areas during the
hot day.</p>
<p>Have you seen any birds? Birds also leave tracks! The large bird
tracks here are generally left by ravens&mdash;big, black birds which eat almost
anything. In the spring and fall, some migrating birds stop briefly. Shrikes,
sparrows, kingbirds and blackbirds are among the visitors and residents of
the dunes. Insects and vegetation provide food and shelter for them.</p>

<p>Since most activity in the dunes takes place at night, very little of this
action is observed. However, in the morning we can stroll in the sand and
unravel the secrets of the previous night. As you look at each set of tracks,
imagine what the animal looks like as it moves. How big is it? How many
feet does it have? Are the feet side by side as though jumping like rodents
or rabbits, or do they alternate as in the walking or running motion of
lizards? How far apart are the prints? Does the animal drag its tail? Now,
where do the tracks go? Follow some animal tracks to see what interactions
have taken place. The same animal may leave different tracks on different
sand surfaces or under difference circumstances. Notice your own tracks
as you walk, run, jump or sit in loose or firm sand. Try it!</p>

<p><i>In many respects these dunes are like any Other deposits of
windblown sand along the coast or in deserts. They reflect variations in the
sand supply and respond to particular wind patterns following the same
basic, natural principles. Several other National Parks and Monuments
have sand dunes of various sizes and composition. Death Valley dunes are
not the largest in the United States by any means! Here the dunes reach a
height of 80 ft. (24 m). They provide a visual change of pace with their soft
lines and shadows in contrast to the sharp, rugged mountain peaks around
them.</i></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
